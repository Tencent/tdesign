title: Upcoming Plan
---

Through open sourcing, TDesign aims to continuously refine and create more perfect and easy-to-use component library products, including more solutions in internationalization, accessibility, and age-adaptation to benefit more products and users.

We are looking forward to your continued attention and feedback on TDesign. We also welcome you to participate in TDesign's open source codevelopment, and progress together with TDesign from open source to a more mature journey.

TDesign upcoming iterate plans are as below:

**What TDesign is doing**

- **Component Iteration**

  - ​Maintain 1.0 LTS version of basic universal UI components and AIGC components​​, improving the functionality of existing foundational components. [TDesign LTS Version Maintain](https://github.com/orgs/Tencent/projects/1/views/35?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Desktop)
  - Simultaneously, begin organizing and addressing unreasonable APIs in the 1.0 LTS version, while advancing the implementation of an atomic TDesign-style CSS solution for use in combination with Headless.

- **Cross-Platform Support**

  - Continue iterating the cross-platform component library TDesign Flutter and advance it to a stable 1.0 version.
  - Provide an officially maintained TDesign Uniapp version of component resources to enrich cross-platform solutions for H5 and mini-program scenarios.

- **AI Programming and Design Applications:**
  - Refactor the current design resource implementation to fully adopt design variables and reduce design variants, ensuring greater consistency with development resources.
  - Provide a series of programming tools, including knowledge bases and MCP tools.
  - Offer a solution for D2C (Design-to-Code) scenarios, suitable for use in AI IDEs like Codebuddy, to enable the conversion of design drafts into engineering code using TDesign components.

**What TDesign are planning to do**

Collaborate with internal and external Tencent businesses to enhance ecosystem development, including low-code platforms, AI programming assistance, D2C (Design-to-Code) capabilities, and provide template resources.

All of the above work is conducted openly on GitHub Projects. [view on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Tencent/projects/1)
